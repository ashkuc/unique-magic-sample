# Unique Network + Magic sample

## Considerations

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Magic SDK to authenticate users and do some basic operations on Unique Network.

As this is just proof of concept, it is not production ready and should not be used in production.

This is also not the best piece of code, but it is good enough to demonstrate the idea. 

Only OPAL testnet is supported.
